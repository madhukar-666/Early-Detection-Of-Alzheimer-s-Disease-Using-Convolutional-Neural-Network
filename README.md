# Early-Detection-Of-Alzheimer-s-Disease-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Network
This project aims to assist in the early detection of Alzheimer’s Disease using deep learning models. Our team of four developed a CNN-based classification system that analyzes MRI images to detect Alzheimer's stages: Mild Demented, Moderate Demented, Non-Demented, and Very Mild Demented. This is our final year capstone project .

**🔍 Project Motivation**
Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive brain disorder with no cure but early diagnosis can significantly improve patient outcomes. Manual examination of MRI images is time-consuming and prone to human error. Automating this process using AI can help reduce diagnosis time and assist medical professionals in early interventions.

**🧰 Tech Stack**
Languages & Frameworks: Python, TensorFlow, Keras

Deep Learning Models: Custom CNN, VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas

Dataset: [Alzheimer MRI Dataset – Kaggle or specified source]


**📊 Performance Metrics**
Accuracy

Loss (Cross-Entropy)

Precision / Recall / F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

Training vs. Validation Curve

**📁 Dataset**
The dataset is structured into 4 classes:

Mild Demented

Moderate Demented

Non Demented

Very Mild Demented

Dataset is pre-processed using resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
